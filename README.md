# space-visibility-tracker

Map of Earth detailing light pollution and space debris to help track the fading visibility of the night's sky.


## Description

This project was made to highlight our ever shrinking visible night's sky. With the amount of space pollution, debris, satellites and with the ever growing light pollution crisis, we are losing more and more of our Milky Way Galaxy that we can see with the naked eye.

This project utilises API's from NASA and Google to display the current extent of light pollution and its area of effect on our planet, as well as tracking the total amount of objects in Earth's orbit. Each object should be clickable with a pop up modal displaying information on that specific satellite.
